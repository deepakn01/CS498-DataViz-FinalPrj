<h3>Chicago Divvy Bikes - Usertype Behavior Patterns</h3>
	<p><strong>About the Visualization:</strong>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In this visualization, I have used the interactive slide show form of the hybrid structure visualization to narrate the behavior patterns of the Chicago Divvy Bikes 
Customers and Subscribers in the year 2017, using the Divvy bike data from the below link.

<br><strong>Datasource : </strong><br>

<br>
<strong>Elements:</strong><br>
1) <strong>Scenes :-</strong> Each page in the visualization is made as a scene. The charts for the scenes are carefully chosen, in such a way 
to see how best to display the data and to easily convey the message intended to be told and what visualization would be best for each scene.

2) <strong>Annotations:-</strong> Each scene is added with the proper Axes, labels, legends, tooltips and annotations to aid the viewer. I have made them consistent across each scenes.
The annotations are not being carried over, they are cleared off when moving to the new scene.<br>

3) <strong>Parameters:-</strong> I have used Customers & Subscribers (the categorical values of Usertype dimension) to aid the viewer to filter the data in each scenes.
I have also added the flexibility to see them both together as well, so that the viewer will loose the overview and reference.

4) <strong>Triggers:-</strong> I have used hyperlinks to aid the user to move forward and backward in his analysis. They are highlighted appropriately so the user is able to see them.
